Objective
The program simulates a traffic light system where selecting a radio button (RED, GREEN, or YELLOW) changes the background color of the window and displays the selected light in a text field.

This Java program creates a Traffic Light Simulator using Swing (a GUI library). It allows users to select a traffic light color using radio buttons. When a button is clicked, the window's background changes to that color, and the selected color is displayed in a text field.
